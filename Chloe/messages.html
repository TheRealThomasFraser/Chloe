<h2> 5 Months!</h2>
<p>WHAT DA HELLLL happy 5 months!!!! Soso happy we're still together. I know you're like "bitch ofc we are" rn, but it still makes me happy that we are. This message will probably end up being shorter than the last one because I've gave you your letter as well and i don't wanna yap repeat myself. Although I will happily repeat the fact that I fucking Love you Chloe. We've had some really good times over the last month! Popplio day, bus treks, lures at the seesaw and so much more. Forever grateful to be your boyfriend, beautiful girl 💜💜💜💜💜</p>

<h2> 4 Months!</h2>
<p> Woohoo! Happy 4 months my precious girl. My one and only. The only person I could ever need or want. I know it's not the biggest milestone, but after all we've been through, being here means a lot. And I'm so glad we are. Sorry that I didn't cook much for today, I've been a bit short on time :[ I hope we've had a good few days. I know I will have, since I've gotten to spend them with you. The last month has been hard on us, but we've came out on top and together. That's what matters. I know you've also been through a lot the last month. Seeing you still have moments of happiness through all that, well, it makes me ridiculously fucking proud of you. You've overcame so much and handled it so well. I don't get how every month, I sit here writing and realising I've grown only more proud of you. I mean it. I know you won't let yourself think it so please, listen to me. I've known and loved you for quite a while now, seen your smile, heard you sob. And I can say with confidence that you're doing amazing. You should be proud of yourself, Chloe. I know I am. I wanted to also thank you again, for letting me love and feel loved by you. You're perfect for me and that's not going to change. Neither is my love for you. I'm here to stay, by your side, supporting you through everything. I love you endlessly, my baby 💜💜💜💜 </p>
